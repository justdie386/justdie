<button>Milky Terry</button>
<div>
    This project was one of my very first, this is a discord bot written in lua, which uses sqlite and button components, sadly, i lost the important parts of the code, but i will still link the github

<button>Bot Creator</button>
<div>
    This project is a gui for windows only written in lua that allows you to easely self host a bot i made, and it allows you to customise it throught settings, so people would not need to have any programming knowledge to use it
